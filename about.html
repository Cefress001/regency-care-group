    <!-- Our Philosophy -->
    <section>
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Regency Care Group was founded to solve a recurring problem in home care: families cycling through caregivers due to mismatches and miscommunication. We believe caregiving is a relationship, not a transaction. That’s why we take a concierge approach—listening deeply, understanding your needs and values, and matching you with a caregiver who feels like family.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to provide Orange County families with certainty, dignity and harmony in their caregiver relationships. We focus on safety, ease, value and ongoing support so you can trust that your loved one is in good hands.</p>

    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our founder has spent decades in family services and coaching. Through this work she saw first‑hand how the right match can transform a household. Determined to raise the standard of private in‑home care, she built Regency to combine high‑touch service with careful screening and thoughtful matching.</p>
        <p>Today, we serve families throughout Coastal Orange County—Newport Coast, Pelican Hill and beyond—earning referrals from estate managers, family offices and professionals who trust our commitment to discretion and excellence.</p>
