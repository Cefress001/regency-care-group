        <h2>The Regency Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Regency Care Group was founded to address a recurring problem in home care: families hire caregivers based on résumés and tasks, only to cycle through three or four placements in the first year. We believe caregiving is a relationship, not a transaction. Our founder drew on years of experience in psychology and addiction recovery to identify that attachment styles, trauma patterns and family dynamics determine whether a placement thrives or implodes.</p>
        <p>Our approach was born from this insight. We combine depth psychology with practical caregiving expertise to create soul‑level compatibility. We see the whole family system and design matches that honor each person as a whole human being, then stay to steward the relationship.</p>

        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>Most agencies dispatch whoever is available. Families end up with a rotation of strangers, eroding trust and stability. Regency exists for families who refuse to gamble. We serve affluent Orange County households seeking certainty, dignity and harmony in the caregiving relationship. By aligning values and communication styles from the beginning, we prevent 80 % of conflicts before they start.</p>
        <p>Our model doesn’t fit everyone. If you’re looking for the fastest, cheapest placement, we’re not for you. But if you value depth, continuity and psychological safety, our work can transform your home life.</p>

        <h2>Our Founder</h2>
        <p>Our founder’s background spans clinical psychology, addiction treatment and family coaching. She observed that the same invisible forces that destroy marriages—unprocessed grief, attachment trauma and communication mismatches—also undermine caregiving relationships. Determined to change the narrative, she built Regency to apply depth psychology and systems thinking to domestic care. Today, Regency serves families in Newport Coast, Pelican Hill and Coto de Caza, earning referrals from estate managers and family offices.</p>
