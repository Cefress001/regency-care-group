        <h1>Our Process</h1>
        <p>Three phases engineered to create matches that last years, not months.</p>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Phase 1: Depth Assessment</h2>
        <p>We begin with a 90‑minute in‑home visit. This is not a checkbox survey—it’s an immersive exploration of your family’s rhythms, communication styles, unspoken tensions and values. We observe how your loved one interacts with you, how conflict shows up and what dignity means to them. We ask questions most agencies never consider: When your parent is stressed, does she withdraw or reach out? Who makes decisions? What fears surface when bringing a stranger into your home? The goal is to understand the psychological terrain before making any introductions.</p>
        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Comprehensive family dynamics assessment, including decision‑makers and household staff</li>
            <li>Personality and attachment profiling</li>
            <li>Discussion of medical and mobility needs</li>
            <li>Listening for unexpressed expectations and boundaries</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Phase 2: Precision Match</h2>
        <p>After the assessment, we curate a short list of 2–3 candidates from our vetted network. Each candidate has at least three years of experience, glowing references and relevant certifications. More importantly, they’ve been interviewed for emotional intelligence, attachment security and relational capacity. We match caregivers whose nervous systems complement your family’s energy, whose communication style resonates with yours and who share your values.</p>
        <h3>What’s Included</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hand‑selected candidate presentation with profiles</li>
            <li>Background checks and reference verification</li>
            <li>Trial shift coordination and debrief</li>
            <li>Replacement guarantee for the first 90 days</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Phase 3: Relational Stewardship</h2>
        <p>The first 90 days reveal what an interview cannot. We stay engaged with monthly or bi‑weekly check‑ins depending on your chosen tier. We mediate conflicts before they become crises, adjust care plans as needs evolve and coach both family and caregiver. This ongoing stewardship is what turns a placement into a partnership.</p>
        <h3>Ongoing Support</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scheduled check‑ins with family and caregiver</li>
            <li>Conflict mediation and relationship coaching</li>
            <li>Care plan adjustments and concierge services (Platinum tier)</li>
            <li>Access to additional training resources</li>
